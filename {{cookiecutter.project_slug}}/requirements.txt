# requirements.txt
# Add your project's core Python dependencies here.
# Example:
# pandas
# numpy
# scikit-learn
# fastapi
# python-dotenv
# boto3

# For development dependencies (e.g., notebooks), consider
# using a separate file like 'requirements-dev.txt' or managing
# dependencies with tools like Poetry or PDM (using pyproject.toml).
# If using separate files, ensure your Dockerfile only installs production dependencies.
# Example dev dependencies:
# jupyterlab
# Add testing/linting tools here if you re-introduce them (e.g., pytest, ruff)

# After installing dependencies in your virtual environment, you can
# generate a pinned list for reproducibility using:
#   pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Or use your chosen dependency management tool's lock mechanism.
